## 🚀 Overview
NeuroScan AI is a **proof-of-concept** medical diagnostic tool that utilizes Deep Learning to classify brain MRI scans into four distinct categories. Designed with a focus on clinical accessibility, the project features a "Glassmorphism" UI and browser-based inference.

### 🎯 Core Capabilities:
* **Glioma Detection:** Identification of high-grade malignancies.
* **Meningioma & Pituitary Analysis:** Structural tumor differentiation.
* **Healthy Baseline:** Near-perfect recall for healthy brain tissue.
* **Dual Input Mode:** Live Webcam scanning + Image File upload.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **AI Engine:** TensorFlow.js / Teachable Machine
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), JavaScript (ES6)
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (SSL Encrypted)
